## Assessment

Lots of people critiqued Elastic's change-of-license move, citing that Elasticsearch was no longer open-source and this negatively affected the software ecosyste. See [Tomer Levy (logz.io)](https://logz.io/blog/open-source-elasticsearch-doubling-down) and [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/blog/the-sspl-is-not-an-open-source-license) as examples.

In the end, Elastic and Amazon [agreed on the trademark issue](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-and-amazon-reach-agreement-on-trademark-infringement-lawsuit) and began to cooperate to provide the official version of Elasticsearch, licensed under SSPL, on Amazon infrastructure with Elastic taking a significant cut. See this 2022 article by Paul Sawyer for _VentureBeat_ titled ["Once frenemies, Elastic and AWS are now besties."](https://venturebeat.com/business/once-frenemies-elastic-and-aws-are-now-besties)

> While the benefit to Elastic in all of this is clear as day, insofar as it gets the world’s biggest public cloud company banging the Elastic Cloud drum, what’s in all of this for Amazon? Put simply, companies accessing Elastic’s services on AWS infrastructure drive a lot of cloud consumption — **which translates into ka-ching for Amazon.**

> “We give our customers choice on which cloud provider they run Elastic Cloud, and we have a lot of customers who run Elastic Cloud on AWS — and as Elastic Cloud grows, the consumption of AWS is growing with it,” Kulkarni said.

Therefore, Elastic's brinkmanship succeeded in compelling Amazon to cooperate. Great for business, not so great for open source.
