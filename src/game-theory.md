# The Game Theory

Let's formalize some of [the story](/).

## Interests of parties

**Elastic:**

1. Make money by getting more users on their Elastic Cloud
2. Commit to supporting open-source software (see Elastic's blog posts, ["Doubling down on open"](https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change) and ["Doubling down on open, part II"](https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change))

Elastic is the party in this case that enacts brinkmanship. The disaster that both companies wish to avoid is

**Amazon:**

1. Make money by increasing usage of their cloud platform

## Inherent uncertainty in the situation

Elastic didn't know how Amazon would respond to their licensing changes&mdash;though they knew that Amazon would no longer be able to continue offering Elasticsearch as it existed without paying Elastic, but could not be certain whether Amazon would cooperate or not.

## Escalation and giving up of control

By issuing the license change, Elastic gave up some degree of control to the market. Decision-making power was pushed to users, as they could decide whether to stay with Elasticsearch under the more restrictive SSPL license or migrate to a different search platform.

Amazon's decision to cooperate was probabilistic, as Elastic was unsure about Amazon leaders' predispositions towards cooperation. Furthermore, unpredictable shifts in the market could have affected Amazon leadership's assessment of the situation.

## Quantitative assessment
